<h1>Vulnerability managment </h1>
The goal of this project is showcase of knowledge and skills in vulnerability management, using an
example of virtual lab with Nessus Essentials Scanner.
I have pre-installed a small corporate network lab with Windows Server 2016, Active Directory and a
few Windows 10 Enterprise. {THERE IS SHOULD BE LINK TO CREATING LAB WITH AD INSTALLATION,
COMING SOON}
I will use Credentialed Scanning . Method of scanning with credentials of endpoints. In my case it will
be account of IT worker with admin privellegies
<h1>Preparations</h1>
First, installIing Nessus Essentials on Kali machine. After installation creating local account for
scanner, and dowloading plugins (Nessus will do it automaticly)
It is important to launch Nessus Service in terminal /bin/systemctl start nessusd.service before work

Before initiating first scan, i have to do a few procedures on endpoints. 
Like a turn on Remote Registry, file and printer sharing, and network discovery. That will give Nessus
the ability to scan registry entries of endpoints, for more accurate and full results of credential
scanning, and of course visibillity of endpoints.
For enabling Remote Registry, i open Services (services.msc) and find Remote Registry entry.

And set it on “Automatic”. That will turn on remote registry. Reboot require.

Network Discovery and file and printer sharing. Anything should be turned on. That will make
endpoints visible.

In registry, on this path HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Polici
es\System adding new DWORD LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy with value 1
That will disable UAC remote restrictions to scanning process.

<h1>Scanning</h1>
Now lets initiate first basic network scan.

Network Scope<br>
192.168.0.1 - Win Server 2016 with AD<br>
192.168.0.2 - Win 10 endpoint (Sales)<br>
192.168.0.3 - Win 10 endpoint (HR)<br>

Wow this network is pretty vulnerable.☠

Most of the vulnerabilities are missing OS updates and some outdated software. In my case, its
WinRAR and 7zip.
Quick look at results of Windows Server 2016 (endpoints on Win 10 have the same issues)

<h1>Mitigation</h1>
This is gonna take some time... So downloading fresh OS updates, and upgrade WinRAR with 7Zip,
and let's check new results.

Much better, but there is still a problems. Let's take a closer look

![Screenshot 2023-11-18 224035](https://github.com/PastorEmil/Vulnerability_Managment/assets/125451135/1ad72cbc-c56e-4457-bccb-297e7681b69d).

Looks like there is still some misconfigurations.Let's take a look at the most critical problem. 
CVE-2017-8563 *allows an elevation of privilege vulnerability due to Kerberos falling back to NT LAN
Manager (NTLM) Authentication Protocol as the default authentication protocol, aka "Windows
Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability".* Microsoft introduces a registry setting that administrators can
use to help make LDAP authentication over SSL/TLS more secure

We need find path HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NTDS\Parameters and add new
registry entry LdapEnforceChannelBinding with value 1
![Screenshot 2023-11-18 225430](https://github.com/PastorEmil/Vulnerability_Managment/assets/125451135/420b0745-9e3a-4968-b486-ad39e2c5d7c2)
Next one is CVE-2013-3900 . 
![Screenshot 2023-11-18 225752](https://github.com/PastorEmil/Vulnerability_Managment/assets/125451135/9863257c-7d03-4266-ae1c-2e5d6ff669ba)
*If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this
vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install
programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose
accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users
who operate with administrative user rights.
Exploitation of this vulnerability requires that a user or application run or install a specially crafted,
signed PE file. An attacker could modify an existing signed file to include malicious code without
invalidating the signature. This code would execute in the context of the privilege in which the
signed PE file was launched.*<p>
Microsoft suggest to enable Windows Authenticode to fix that problem.
Windows Authenticode is a digital signature format that is used to determine the origin and integrity
of software binaries. Authenticode uses Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) #7 signed data
and X.509 certificates to bind an Authenticode-signed binary to the identity of a software publisher.
The term "Authenticode signature" refers to a digital signature format that is generated and verified
using the WinVerifyTrust function<p>
There is 2 new registry entries to fix that cryptographic vulnerability.<br>
In these paths HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Cryptography\Wintrust\Config and HKE
Y_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\Cryptography\Wintrust\Config (for x64
systems) i added registry key EnableCertPaddingCheck with value 1

Done.Moving next.
Wow, that's a bunch of vulnerabilities . They are from “hardware family”, when trough “holes” in
CPU, attacker can gather information about target. All these CVE's were fixed in Windows
updates,but first mitigations was pretty harsh, like turning off hyper-threading, which seriously slow
down the computer. But in my case this is Windows Server 2016, which didn't get that propper
update, but still can be repaired by hands. According to vendor recommendations, we should add 2
new registry keys to fix them.

On this path HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Memory
Management add 2 new registry keys.
FeatureSettingsOverride with value 48 . 
FeatureSettingsOverrideMask with value 3

Next one.
CVE-2017-8529
![Screenshot 2023-11-18 231913](https://github.com/PastorEmil/Vulnerability_Managment/assets/125451135/aa80ca1d-3b4a-4446-a685-9545f760742e)
This vulnerability may help attacker to gain information about machine trough affected Microsoft
browser.
*An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could potentially read data that was not
intended to be disclosed. Note that the vulnerability would not allow an attacker to either execute
code or to elevate a user’s rights directly, but the vulnerability could be used to obtain information in
an attempt to further compromise the affected system.*
And according to Microsoft, “exploitation is less likely”. The possibillity of existing Microsoft browser
users is still be, so we will fix this.

Adding the new registry key FEATURE_ENABLE_PRINT_INFO_DISCIOSURE_FIX on the path HKEY_LOC
AL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main\FeatureControl. And
create new DWORD iexplore.exe with value 1

Allright, Nessus shows the last vulnerability , SMB signing should be enabled.
![Screenshot 2023-11-27 190402](https://github.com/PastorEmil/Vulnerability_Managment/assets/125451135/778fca64-222e-46e7-8d46-0abf28117aca)

To do this, i opened Local Security Policies at the endpoint , and look for Security Options for policies 
Microsoft network client/server

Parameters must be set as in attached screenshot. ms net client : Digitally sign communications (if
server agrees) - Enabled ; ms net server : Digitally sign communications (always) - Enabled<br>
After that, endpoints should be rebooted(Or after next step).<p>
Besides. Microsoft strongly recommend us to stop using SMBv1, because it's pretty vulnerable.
Infamous WannaCry was performed trough SMBv1. In my case, Win Server 2016 have it by default,
so let's disable it.<br>
Through the PowerShell (Run as Administrator!) this command checks smb1 status on server Get-SmbServerConfiguration |

Ok. Lets rescan VM's after all these manipulations.

Seems much better now
*IMPORTANT NOTE* 
Win Server still have some "issues" . 
![Screenshot 2023-11-29 174219](https://github.com/PastorEmil/Vulnerability_Managment/assets/125451135/dd9a71fa-ca7e-48f9-b320-c8227fff5343)

In our case, IP forwarding is really enabled, because our server is used as router for endpoints, for
educational purposes of course. And DHCP server too. So ignore them (for educational purposes, for
sure)<p>
